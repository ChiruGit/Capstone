Public surveys are predominantly used when forecasting election outcomes.
While the approach has had significant successes, the surveys have had
their failures as well, especially when it comes to accuracy and reliability. As a
result, it becomes challenging for political parties to spend their campaign budgets
in a manner that facilitates the growth of a favorable and verifiable public
opinion. Consequently, it is critical that a more accurate methodology to predict
election outcome is developed. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the impact
of utilizing dynamic public data on predicting the outcome of elections. Our
model yielded a 0.71 Pearson Correlation between derived features and percentage
of votes predicted. Hence, we can conclude that candidates having affiliation
with notable organizations and having participation in public events greatly increases
their likelihood to win. Also, having Wikipedia presence with some notable
key words like ’Congress’, ’Republican’ and ’House’, makes them stand
out in their constituencies. Together these features explain 80 percent of the response
variable, which in this case is percentage of votes the candidates get in
their respective constituencies.
